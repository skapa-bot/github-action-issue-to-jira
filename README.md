# Issue To Jira

This GitHub Action will create a Jira ticket whenever a new GitHub Issue is raised. Any comments on the issue will be posted to the Jira ticket as comments and any labels applied/removed will be synced

Please check the [open issues](https://github.com/mheap/github-action-issue-to-jira/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and add a comment if any of the feature requests would be useful for you.

## Usage

```yaml
